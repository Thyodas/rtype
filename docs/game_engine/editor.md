### The Editor

The editor is a tool that allows you to create and edit game objects and scenes.

It is built using the game engine itself, so it is a good example of what can be done with it.

### Editor Interface

The editor interface is built using ImGui.

It is composed of a menu bar, a scene view, and a hierarchy view.
